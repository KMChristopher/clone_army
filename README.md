2019.05.29 - here are some changes to try and commit ... Well, where is this branch on GitHub??? 

____

This is an addition after I moved the folder ... 

So, if you move a repo folder, in Git, when you do the COMMAND: cd, you have to include the parent folder of the repo - for example:

cd GitHub_Repo/clone_army -->

Then it works! :D
